Javascript is a text based language used both on client side as well as server side that allows the web application to be interactive.

* Data Types describe the different kinds of data we would be storing in a variable;
Data Types in Javascript- (Primitive)
1. Undefined
2. Boolean
3. Number
4. String
5. BigInt
6. Symbol

* We have 'var, let and const' as variables in Javascript, we don't manually need to assign data type ourselves.
var myName = 'Harshit';

How to find data type of given value?
typeOf();

console.log(typeOf(myName));	// O/P: String
var myAge = 20;
console.log(typeOf(myAge));	// O/P: Number
var amIHarshit = true;
console.log(typeOf(amIHarshit));	// O/P: Boolean

# BUG-
9 - "5" -> 4;

** Difference between 'Null' and 'Undefined'-
Null -> Intentional absence of the value in a variable.
var useless = null;

Undefined -> It means the value doesn't exist in the compiler.
	  -> It is a global object.
	  -> No value is assigned to the variable.
var standBy;

null==undefined -> true;
null===undefined -> false;

# BUG-
Data type of 'null' is object, but 'null' is not an object;
Data type of undefined is undefined;

	      |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
	      | NULL -> Variable is Empty, UNDEFINED -> Variable doesn't exist; |
	      |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
Undefined is used to access the values that doesn't exist;
var temp = ['a','b','c'];
if(temp[3]===undefined) console.log("Value doesn't exist");
		else console.log(temp[3]);

* Undefined is an ECMASCRIPT (ES1) feature;

NaN -> Not a Number;
NaN is a property of Global Object like undefined is;
isNaN() returns if the value is not a number;

In equality comparisons, NaN does not equals any value, including itself;
NaN===NaN -> false, Not a number can't be identical to anything;
isNaN(NaN) -> true;
returns true on anything but number;
